        Our story begins in 1990 in the heart of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur. It was where Kofi opened its first store, selling world-class fresh-roasted coffee beans, from around
        the world for our precious customer to take home. Many famous celebrities came here to purchase our beans that flew over the world. Now, as technology is improving day by day, Kofi is now joining the E-commerce world! 
        We are so excited to have you to join our brand new adventure!
