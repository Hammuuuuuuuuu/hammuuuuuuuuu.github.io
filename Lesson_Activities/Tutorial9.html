            When Minori was a child, she would often have bad luck. After one particular day, 
            when she dropped the baton during a race at school, Minori stayed home out of guilt and fear that her classmates would be angry at her. 
            She then saw Haruka from ASRUN, singing solo on TV. Minori was encouraged by Haruka's words that "Tomorrow will always be a better day", 
            and has been a fan of Haruka ever since. Like her longtime inspiration, Minori has also set her sights on becoming an idol. 
            She has tried her hand at over 50 auditions, but failed every single one. Despite this, 
            she never gives up and continues to try in order to achieve her dream. <p><a href = "#topsite">Back to Top</a></p>

            As a child, Haruka had a difficult time smiling even when she was happy. She was inspired to become an idol when, while at a mall, 
            an idol invited Haruka to dance with her onstage, causing Haruka to smile. 
            Haruka realized she wanted to become an idol upon hearing that the girl who invited her to dance was filled with hope by her having fun. 
            As a child and while in middle school, Haruka was an athlete, specifically a basketball player. <p align =right><a href = "#topsite">Back to Top</a></p>

            Airi wanted to become an idol when she was young, as she admired the way they danced, sang and made people smile, 
            and wanted to be able to do the same. At the same time, 
            she wanted to be more girlish, as she was made fun of for being a tomboy and getting into fights with boys.
            Airi later debuted as a member of the idol group QT. She was a popular idol that appeared on many variety shows. 
            One of her most well-known TV personas was The Masked Variety Idol, Happy Everyday. Due to her talent working in television, 
            her agency urged her to stop being an idol and to become a TV personality instead. 
            Upon overhearing her manager outright saying that Airi is very average as an idol, 
            she rejected this offer, resulting in her quitting the group. <p><a href = "#topsite">Back to Top</a></p>

            Shizuku is a former member of the idol group Cheerful＊Days, specifically its 3rd generation. 
            Her friend applied to the position for her without Shizuku's knowledge, 
            but she decided to go with it after being accepted. She trained to become an idol at the same time as Airi, 
            who openly viewed her as a rival. She is best known among the fans for her beautiful, mysterious, and mature appearance. 
            However, this causes jealousy from the other members of her group, who think she has no special talent and is only popular for her looks. <p align = right><a href = "#topsite">Back to Top</a></p>
